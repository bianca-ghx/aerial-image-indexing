# Aerial Image Indexing

This project focuses on efficient indexing of aerial images. The primary objective is to develop and implement algorithms that can index a large collection of aerial images, enabling quick and accurate searches based on image content. This project leverages ResNet, a powerful convolutional neural network, for feature extraction from images, and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient indexing and retrieval. 
 

## Installation
To install and run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/bianca-ghx/aerial-image-indexing.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd aerial-image-indexing
    ```
3. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed.

## Usage
To use the aerial image indexing system, follow these instructions:

1. Prepare your dataset by placing the aerial images in the appropriate directories as specified in the project.
2. Open and run the `uc-merced-indexing.ipynb` notebook to preprocess the images, build the index, and perform retrieval tasks.
